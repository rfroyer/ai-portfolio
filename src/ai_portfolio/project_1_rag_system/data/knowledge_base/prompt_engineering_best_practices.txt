PROMPT ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES

1. CLARITY AND SPECIFICITY
- Be explicit about what you want
- Avoid ambiguous language
- Specify the format of desired output
- Example: "Generate a JSON response with fields: title, summary, keywords"

2. CONTEXT AND ROLE DEFINITION
- Define the AI's role or persona
- Provide relevant background information
- Set expectations for tone and style
- Example: "You are a senior software architect. Explain this concept..."

3. EXAMPLES AND DEMONSTRATIONS
- Provide few-shot examples of desired output
- Show input-output pairs
- Helps the model understand patterns
- Example: "Here are 3 examples of good summaries: [examples]"

4. CONSTRAINTS AND GUIDELINES
- Specify length limits
- Define forbidden content
- Set quality standards
- Example: "Keep response under 200 words. Avoid technical jargon."

5. ITERATIVE REFINEMENT
- Start with a basic prompt
- Test and evaluate outputs
- Refine based on results
- Repeat until satisfied

6. TEMPERATURE AND PARAMETERS
- Use lower temperature (0.3-0.5) for factual tasks
- Use higher temperature (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks
- Adjust max_tokens based on desired output length

7. CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROMPTING
- Ask the model to explain reasoning
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Improves accuracy on complex problems
- Example: "Think step-by-step before providing your answer"

8. SYSTEM PROMPTS
- Define system-level instructions
- Set consistent behavior across interactions
- Establish guardrails and boundaries
